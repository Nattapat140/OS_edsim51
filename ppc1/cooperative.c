     *     otherwise, find a thread ID that is not in use,

     * [TODO] below
     * a. update the bit mask
         (and increment thread count, if you use a thread count,
          but it is optional)
       b. calculate the starting stack location for new thread
       c. save the current SP in a temporary
          set SP to the starting location for the new thread
       d. push the return address fp (2-byte parameter to
          ThreadCreate) onto stack so it can be the return
          address to resume the thread. Note that in SDCC
          convention, 2-byte ptr is passed in DPTR.  but
          push instruction can only push it as two separate
          registers, DPL and DPH.
       e. we want to initialize the registers to 0, so we
          assign a register to 0 and push it four times
          for ACC, B, DPL, DPH.  Note: push #0 will not work
          because push takes only direct address as its operand,
          but it does not take an immediate (literal) operand.
       f. finally, we need to push PSW (processor status word)
          register, which consist of bits
           CY AC F0 RS1 RS0 OV UD P
          all bits can be initialized to zero, except <RS1:RS0>
          which selects the register bank.
          Thread 0 uses bank 0, Thread 1 uses bank 1, etc.
          Setting the bits to 00B, 01B, 10B, 11B will select
          the register bank so no need to push/pop registers
          R0-R7.  So, set PSW to
          00000000B for thread 0, 00001000B for thread 1,
          00010000B for thread 2, 00011000B for thread 3.
       g. write the current stack pointer to the saved stack
          pointer array for this newly created thread ID
       h. set SP to the saved SP in step c.
       i. finally, return the newly created thread ID.
